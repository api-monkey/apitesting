# 🐒 API Monkey
**Self-service, no-code API testing for modern teams**

API Monkey is an open-source platform that simplifies **API testing, collaboration, and quality assurance** — without writing boilerplate test code or standing up complex infrastructure.

## The Problem

Teams build APIs faster than ever, but testing them is still hard.

To properly test APIs, organizations typically need:

- QA engineers to write and maintain test code
- Load test engineers to design performance tests
- Security specialists to validate API security
- CI/CD pipelines, test data, reporting frameworks, and load infrastructure

This leads to **high cost, slow feedback, and operational complexity**.

## Swagger / OpenAPI–Driven Testing (Zero Setup)

API Monkey can read your **Swagger / OpenAPI (2.0 / 3.x) definitions** and get you started instantly.

When you import your API specification, API Monkey automatically:

- Discovers all API endpoints
- Understands request and response schemas
- **Generates realistic test data from schema definitions**
- Creates automated functional test cases (positive and negative)
- Organizes everything into a reusable test collection

There is **no need to manually create datasets, mock payloads, or write test code**.  
API Monkey handles endpoint discovery, test creation, and data generation for you.

### Built for Collaboration

Once the test collection is created, you can:

- Share collections across teams
- Invite users to collaborate
- Allow developers, QA, and business users to run tests
- Maintain a single, contract-driven source of truth

### Why This Matters

- Zero-configuration onboarding for existing APIs
- Eliminates boilerplate test and data setup
- Keeps tests aligned with evolving API contracts
- Enables self-service testing for non-programmers
- Speeds up feedback across product, engineering, and QA

If you already have Swagger, API Monkey can turn it into **test cases, test data, and shared workflows — automatically**.

## How is API Monkey Different

- **Open Source** – Run locally, on-prem, or in your own cloud
- **No Code** – Designed for developers *and* non-developers
- **Self Service** – Reduce dependency on specialized testing roles
- **No Sharing Restrictions** – No SaaS lock-in, no licensing limits

## ⭐ Why AGPL?

The AGPL license ensures that:

- ApiMonkey remains free and open-source.
- Improvements made by others in hosted environments (SaaS, internal tools) must also be shared.
- No one can take ApiMonkey, host it as a competing API service, and keep their modifications proprietary.

This aligns with our mission to keep the tool open while preventing commercial exploitation without contribution.
